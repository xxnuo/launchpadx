Run

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /Library/Preferences/FeatureFlags/Domain
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/FeatureFlags/Domain/SpotlightUI.plist SpotlightPlus -dict Enabled -bool false

Then restart the system, and the familiar official launchpad is back!

Therefore, this project is temporarily suspended from updates! You can use the official launchpad！

Apple, give me back my launchpad!

An open-source macOS launchpad, developed with SwiftUI and AppKit. Using the latest liquid glass effect.

[中文](./README_zh.md)

## What is this?

Today, I happily upgraded to the latest macOS system.

When I clicked the App button in the Dock, I was shocked to see that my launcher pad was gone!

WTF? Why would Apple remove the launchpad? The last time a company removed the start menu was when Windows 8 was killed.

Come back, my launchpad!
