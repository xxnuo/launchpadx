Apple, give me back my launcher pad!

## What is this?

Today, I happily upgraded to the latest macOS system.

When I clicked the App button in the Dock, I was shocked to see that my launcher pad was gone!

WTF? Why would Apple remove the launcher pad? The last time a company removed the start menu was when Windows 8 was killed.

Come back, my launcher pad!
